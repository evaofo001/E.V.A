# E.V.A Project

## Overview
This is a GitHub import from https://github.com/evaofo001/E.V.A

## Current State
The repository contains only a README.md file with the title "E.V.A". There is no source code, configuration files, package definitions, or any indication of what type of application this should be (frontend, backend, full-stack, etc.).

## Project Structure
```
.
├── README.md (contains only "# E.V.A")
└── .replit (Replit configuration)
```

## Setup Status
- **Languages/Frameworks**: None detected
- **Dependencies**: None found
- **Build System**: None present
- **Workflows**: Cannot be configured without application code

## Next Steps
This appears to be an empty repository. To proceed, the project needs:
1. Application code (frontend/backend/full-stack)
2. Package configuration (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
3. Build/run instructions

The user should either:
- Add code to this repository
- Import a different repository with actual application code
- Specify what type of application should be built
